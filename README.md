## Results
- Deliverable 1:  Preprocessing the Data for PCA
    - Created: crypto_clustering.ipynb
    - Data: crypto_data.csv
    - Cleaned and scaled the dataset

- Deliverable 2:  Reducing Data Dimensions using PCA
    - Reduced data to 3 principal components
    - Created a DataFrame with the results

- Deliverable 3:  Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-means
    - Created an Elbow Curve to determine beset value for K

    - Ran the K-means model using K=4 and created predictions
    - Created a DataFrame with the results

- Deliverable 4:  Visualizing Crypto Results
    - Created a 3D Scatter Plot with PCA results
